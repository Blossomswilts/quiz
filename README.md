# Full stack Quiz - Michael Tranquillo


## This app will provide you with a list of 8 questions that are multiple choice.

## For each question you get wrong, -5 seconds will be removed from the total time left.

## The score will be dependant on your time left, in which the score is === to time left when finished with the quiz. 

### The high scores will be recorded, and kept to the high score section using local storage. 

## Some of the problems solved that are of interest.

* Creating a proper pull and set for local storage using JSON.
* Using one HTML page, setting a hide and unhide feature when moving on to the next section. 
* Storing the correct index for the questions and answers. 
* Updating score based on time. 
* Applying functions that will set to the next function when conditions are met. 
* Ensuring the time properly resets after the restart action is clicked. 
* Pulling the data just outside the loop to iterate which index + 1 you are on with text.
